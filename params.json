The config file should be placed in the root directory of the bot (i.e. the same directory as the src folder is placed in).\r\n<pre>\r\n{\r\n    \"nickname\": \"PyBot\", \r\n    \"realname\": \"PyBot\",  \r\n    \"servers\": {\r\n        \"freenode\": {\r\n            \"address\": \"irc.freenode.org\",\r\n            \"port\": 6697,\r\n            \"ssl\": true, \r\n            \"identify\": false,\r\n            \"channels\": [\"#python\"]\r\n        }\r\n    },\r\n    \"commands\": {\r\n        \"cf\": {\r\n            \"tkn\": \"cloudflare token\", \r\n            \"z\": \"site\", \r\n            \"email\": \"email\"\r\n        }\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n</pre>\r\n\r\n---\r\n###License\r\nIs found in the license file.
