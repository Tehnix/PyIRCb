All public methods (without a _ infront) will be available through the bot by doing: \r\n<code>$methodName &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; .</code>\r\nAll private methods (with _ infront of method name) will not be accessible through the bot, but will ofcourse be accessible in the class.\r\n\r\nThe commands usage is documented in the docstring of the method. This is then used when you do $help to get a list of commands and how to use them.\r\n\r\nStandard commands are:\r\n\r\n<code>$help</code>\r\n\r\nOutputs the available commands and their usage.\r\n\r\n<code>$note : Usage: note &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nIf &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is supplied, it saves a note to the given nickname.\r\nIf &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is omitted, it lists out all notes that are not set to 'read'.\r\n\r\n<code>$notelist : Usage: notelist</code>\r\n\r\nOutputs a list of all notes with their corresponding id's.\r\n\r\n<code>$noteread : Usage: noteread &lt;id&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nGives a note the status of 'read', so it doesn't show in $note.\r\n\r\n<code>$backin : Usage: backin &lt;time&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nSaves a your expected time of return. Used like this: \r\n\r\n`$backin 2.5h` (for 2 and a half hours)\r\n\r\n`$backin 30m` (for 30 minutes)\r\n\r\n<code>$back : Usage: back &lt;nickname&gt;</code>\r\n\r\nOutputs when the given nickname (person) will be back (if the person saved it with $backin).\r\n","tagline":"A python based IRC bot","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
