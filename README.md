##Files & Usage
####1x01        commands_list.py
This is the file where you put all your commands. All public methods (without a _ infront) will be available through the bot by doing: 
<code>$methodName &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; .</code>
All private methods (with _ infront of method name) will not be accessible through the bot, but will ofcourse be accessible in the class.

The commands usage is documented in the docstring of the method. This is then used when you do $help to get a list of commands and how to use them.

Standard commands are:

<code>$help</code>

Outputs the available commands and their usage.

<code>$note : Usage: note &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt;</code>

If &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is supplied, it saves a note to the given nickname.
If &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is omitted, it lists out all notes that are not set to 'read'.

<code>$notelist : Usage: notelist</code>

Outputs a list of all notes with their corresponding id's.

<code>$noteread : Usage: noteread &lt;id&gt;</code>

Gives a note the status of 'read', so it doesn't show in $note.

<code>$backin : Usage: backin &lt;time&gt;</code>

Saves a your expected time of return. Used like this: 

`$backin 2.5h` (for 2 and a half hours)

`$backin 30m` (for 30 minutes)

<code>$back : Usage: back &lt;nickname&gt;</code>

Outputs when the given nickname (person) will be back (if the person saved it with $backin).
