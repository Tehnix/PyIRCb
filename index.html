        <h1>PyBot</h1>

<p>An easily extensible IRC bot written in python 3.</p>

<hr><h3>Configuration</h3>

<p>The configuration file uses JSON. You can create a default configuration file by running the program with the <code>-c</code> parameter.</p>

<p>The following is an example of a configuration file. The config file should be placed in the root directory of the bot (i.e. the same directory as the src folder is placed in).</p>
