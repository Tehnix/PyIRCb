<h4>0x03        Installation</h4>

<p>Clone the repository</p>

<p><code>$ git clone <a href="mailto:git@github.com">git@github.com</a>:ZealDev/T3hb0t.git</code></p>

<hr><h2>Files &amp; Usage</h2>

<h4>1x01        commands_list.py</h4>

<p>This is the file where you put all your commands. All public methods (without a _ infront) will be available through the bot by doing: 
<code>$methodName &lt;arg1&gt; &lt;arg2&gt; .</code>
All private methods (with _ infront of method name) will not be accessible through the bot, but will ofcourse be accessible in the class.</p>

<p>The commands usage is documented in the docstring of the method. This is then used when you do $help to get a list of commands and how to use them.</p>

<p>Standard commands are:</p>

<p><code>$help</code></p>

<p>Outputs the available commands and their usage.</p>

<p><code>$note : Usage: note &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt;</code></p>

<p>If &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is supplied, it saves a note to the given nickname.
If &lt;to nickname&gt; &lt;note&gt; is omitted, it lists out all notes that are not set to 'read'.</p>

<p><code>$notelist : Usage: notelist</code></p>

<p>Outputs a list of all notes with their corresponding id's.</p>

<p><code>$noteread : Usage: noteread &lt;id&gt;</code></p>

<p>Gives a note the status of 'read', so it doesn't show in $note.</p>

<p><code>$backin : Usage: backin &lt;time&gt;</code></p>

<p>Saves a your expected time of return. Used like this: </p>

<p><code>$backin 2.5h</code> (for 2 and a half hours)</p>

<p><code>$backin 30m</code> (for 30 minutes)</p>

<p><code>$back : Usage: back &lt;nickname&gt;</code></p>

<p>Outputs when the given nickname (person) will be back (if the person saved it with $backin).</p>
